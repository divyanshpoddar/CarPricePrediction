## 📖 Overview
Car price prediction is essential for both buyers and sellers in the automotive industry. In this project, we build a predictive model using various machine learning techniques to estimate car prices based on a range of features. The project includes:
- Data preprocessing and visualization to gain insights from the dataset.
- Building and training multiple regression models to predict car prices.
- Evaluating the models based on performance metrics.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from an open car dataset [available here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devgupta2619/Car_Price_Prediction_with_Machine_Learning/refs/heads/main/car%20data.csv). It contains the following key features:
- **Car Model**: Brand and model of the car.
- **Year**: Year of manufacture.
- **Mileage**: Distance traveled by the car (in km).
- **Fuel Type**: Petrol, Diesel, or Electric.
- **Transmission**: Automatic or Manual.
- **Price**: Price of the car (target variable).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
The project is implemented in Python with the following libraries:
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Numpy**: Numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: Visualization tools.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms and utilities.
- **XGBoost**: Advanced gradient boosting algorithms for regression.
- **Graphviz**: For visualizing decision trees.

## 🤖 Models Implemented
Several machine learning models were explored for predicting car prices, including:
1. 🌳 **Random Forest Regressor**
2. 🚀 **XGBoost Regressor**

These models were evaluated based on:
- **📉 Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **📊 R-Squared (R²) Score**
- **📏 Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**

## 📈 Results
The **[Insert Best Model]** provided the best performance with an R² score of **[Insert Score]**, demonstrating its ability to explain the variance in car prices based on the provided features.
